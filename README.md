Hello everyone, I am Jigidy. I'm just getting started. Have begun with The Odin Project which will give me a gateway into the full world of coding, but much more interested in things like
- Ethical Hacking 
- Privacy and Security
- Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning are my idols.

I'm very much a beginner though, so right now any coding is good coding for learning purposes :). I'm looking forward to learning more. My hope is to get through The Odin Project by the end of the year.

Julian
