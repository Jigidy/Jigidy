Thanks for visiting my profile. 

My name is Julian PG Riches, although I often go by the online moniker Jigidy. I am a new developer just getting into the field, and currently am cruising through the Odin Project at a decent clip while finding ways to contribute to projects online, even in new ways. 

Right now a lot of my contributions are around proofreading, such as editing documents or checking HTML and CSS syntax, but I'm always trying to push the boundaries of what I am able to do. My long-term ambitions are to be a full-stack developer, although I'm interested in several significant branches of development such as ethical hacking and data management. 

Personal interests include involvement in progressive politics, Dungeons and Dragons, board games and video games, spending time in nature and in cottages. I love sushi, I'm a pescetarian, and I care about people being able to have greater control over their lives. 

If you have a project you need help with that you think I could contribute to, even with my limited skills at the moment, feel free to get in contact with me either on here or on Twitter. Right now I keep it to one project at a time, but when the slot is open I'll consider most projects. 

Thanks for reading,
Julian Riches
